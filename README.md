# LunarScrap
Risk of Rain 2 mod that adds Lunar Scrap into the game, as well as Lunar 3D printers (duplicators).

Now has a few config options, if you find yourself not being able to scrap some items please flip on the BypassRemovableCheck.

Should:tm: work with most other mods by default, unless they mess with scrappers/CostTypes/printers too much.
